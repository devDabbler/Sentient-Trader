  - Adjusts confidence: +15% if similar patterns succeeded, -25% if they failed
  - Tracks outcomes (WIN/LOSS) when positions close for continuous learning
* **⚙️ Configuration:**
  - Set `SIGNAL_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama` (default) or `openai`
  - For Ollama: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` (768 dims, FREE)
  - For OpenAI: Uses text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dims, ~$0.01/1000 signals)
* **📈 Integration Points:**

  - **Qwen 2.5:7B** - General reasoning and trading analysis
  - **Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3** - Structured JSON output and sentiment analysis
  - Ollama manages VRAM automatically (loads on demand, unloads after idle)
* **📊 Compare Mode (Recommended):** Run BOTH local models and use highest confidence
  - Model 1: Uses `AI_ANALYZER_MODEL` from `.env`
  - Model 2: Uses `AI_ANALYZER_MODEL_2` from `.env`
  - System automatically picks the best result (highest confidence)
* **🔄 LLM Mode Options:**
  - `compare` - Run BOTH local models, pick highest confidence (recommended)
  - `primary` - Use ONLY `AI_ANALYZER_MODEL` (fastest, single model)
* **⚙️ Available Models:**
  ```powershell
  ollama pull qwen2.5:7b                       # General reasoning (~4.7GB VRAM)
  ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-q4_K_M  # JSON/structured output (~4.4GB VRAM)
  ollama pull nomic-embed-text                 # Embeddings for RAG (~274MB VRAM)
  ```
* **🎯 VRAM Management (RTX 3080 Ti 12GB):**
  - Models load on-demand and unload after ~5 min idle
  - Compare mode runs models sequentially (not simultaneous) for VRAM efficiency
* **📝 Configuration (`.env`):**
  ```bash
  # LLM Mode: compare (both local), primary (single local)
  ANALYSIS_LLM_MODE=compare
  
  # Primary local Ollama model
  AI_ANALYZER_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b
  
  # Second local Ollama model for comparison
  AI_ANALYZER_MODEL_2=mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-q4_K_M
  ```
* **📊 How Compare Mode Works:**
  1. Runs analysis through first local model (your `AI_ANALYZER_MODEL`)
  2. Runs same analysis through second local model (your `AI_ANALYZER_MODEL_2`)
  3. Compares confidence scores, uses the BEST result
  4. Logs both results with which model "won" for transparency

- **On-chain verification** via Solana RPC
- **Risk scoring** based on contract safety metrics
- **Social sentiment** analysis from X/Twitter
- **Multi-source data** aggregation (DexScreener + Pump.fun)

### Phase Completion Status

✅ **Phase 1: Core Solana RPC Integration** (COMPLETE)
- Mint authority & freeze authority inspection
- LP token ownership verification
- Hard red flag enforcement (auto-reject dangerous tokens)

✅ **Phase 2: Holder Distribution Analysis** (COMPLETE)
- On-chain holder concentration metrics
- Whale risk detection (top 1, 5, 10, 20 percentages)
- 90% reduction in RPC calls via optimized strategy

✅ **Phase 3: Enhanced Validation** (COMPLETE)
- On-chain metadata inspection (impersonation risk detection)
- Cross-source price validation (DexScreener vs Birdeye)
- RPC load balancing (3 endpoints with automatic failover)
- Enhanced rate limiting with exponential backoff

### Key Services

```
services/
├── dex_launch_hunter.py          # Main orchestrator
├── solana_mint_inspector.py      # Mint/freeze authority checks
├── solana_lp_analyzer.py         # LP ownership verification

├── x_sentiment_service.py        # X/Twitter sentiment
└── launch_announcement_monitor.py # Pump.fun integration
```

### Scoring System

**Composite Score (0-100):**
- **Pump Potential** (0-100): Market metrics and price momentum
- **Velocity Score** (0-100): Price change over timeframes
- **Safety Score** (0-100): Contract safety (mint/freeze/LP/holder checks)
- **Liquidity Score** (0-100): Trading depth and volume
- **Social Buzz** (0-100): X/Twitter sentiment

**Alert Thresholds:**
- ≥ 70: 🚨 CRITICAL priority alert
- ≥ 60: 🔔 HIGH priority alert
- ≥ 30: Gets X/Twitter sentiment enrichment
- < 30: No alert (low score)

### Hard Red Flags (Auto-Reject)

Tokens are automatically blacklisted if:
- ❌ Mint authority retained (can mint infinite tokens)
- ❌ Freeze authority retained (honeypot - users can't sell)
- ❌ LP tokens in EOA wallet (rug pull risk)
- ❌ Already detected as honeypot

### Configuration Options (NEW - December 2025)

**Lenient Mode** - Most new Solana tokens keep mint/freeze authority initially:
```python
from models.dex_models import HunterConfig

config = HunterConfig(
    lenient_solana_mode=True,    # Allow tokens with mint/freeze (most new launches have these)
    discovery_mode="aggressive",  # "conservative", "balanced", or "aggressive"
    min_liquidity_usd=500.0,     # Lower for early launches
    min_composite_score=20.0,    # Show more tokens for manual evaluation
)
```

**Discovery Modes:**
- `aggressive` - Lowest filters, finds most tokens (higher risk)
- `balanced` - Moderate filters (default)
- `conservative` - Strict filters, fewer but safer tokens

**Why Lenient Mode?** Many legitimate meme coins keep mint/freeze authority for the first few hours/days. Strict mode (default before this update) would filter out ~90% of new launches. With lenient mode ON, these tokens are flagged with warnings but not blacklisted.

**Environment Variables (add to .env):**
```bash
# DEX Hunter Settings
DEX_LENIENT_MODE=true       # true = allow risky tokens, false = strict filtering
DEX_DISCOVERY_MODE=aggressive  # aggressive, balanced, or conservative
DEX_MIN_LIQUIDITY=500       # Minimum liquidity in USD
```

### RPC Optimization

- **Two-tier strategy**: `getTokenLargestAccounts` (lightweight) → fallback to `getProgramAccounts`
- **Load balancing**: 3 RPC endpoints with automatic routing
- **Failover**: Automatic endpoint switching on rate limits
- **Batch operations**: `getMultipleAccounts` for efficiency
- **Result**: 90% reduction in RPC calls vs. naive implementation

### Testing

```bash
# Run automated test suite
tests/RUN_DEX_HUNTER_TESTS.bat

# Or run manually
pytest tests/test_dex_hunter_complete.py -v

# Interactive testing with real tokens
python tests/test_dex_hunter_manual.py
```

## 📊 Advanced Systems

### 1. Entropy Market Filter

Uses Shannon and Approximate Entropy to measure market chaos.

* **< 30 (Structured):** Ideal for trading
* **> 70 (Noisy):** Trading automatically blocked to prevent whipsaws

### 2. Advanced Opportunity Scanner

Finds plays before they rocket using customizable filters:

* **Buzzing Stocks:** Combines volume spikes with social sentiment
* **Reverse Merger:** Detects shell companies and unusual dark pool activity
* **Penny Stock Risk:** Auto-detects dilution history and reverse splits
* **DEX Launches:** Identifies new token launches on Solana with on-chain verification

### 3. ML-Enhanced Analysis

For maximum confidence, run the triple-validation scanner:

```python
from services.ml_enhanced_scanner import MLEnhancedScanner
scanner = MLEnhancedScanner()
# Returns trades only if ML, LLM, and Technicals agree
trades = scanner.scan_top_options_with_ml(min_ensemble_score=70.0)
```

### 4. On-Chain Verification Pipeline

For DEX Hunter token analysis:

```python
from services.dex_launch_hunter import DEXLaunchHunter
from services.token_safety_analyzer import TokenSafetyAnalyzer

hunter = DEXLaunchHunter()
analyzer = TokenSafetyAnalyzer()

# Scan for new launches
tokens = await hunter.scan_launches()

# Analyze with on-chain verification
for token in tokens:
    safety = await analyzer.analyze_token(
        contract_address=token.contract_address,
        chain=token.chain,
        pool_address=token.pool_address
    )
    
    if safety.risk_level == RiskLevel.EXTREME:
        print(f"🚨 Rejected: {token.symbol} - {safety.risk_reasons}")
    else:
        print(f"✅ Score: {safety.safety_score}/100")
```

### 5. Jupiter DEX Price Validation (NEW - December 2025)

For Crypto Breakout Service - cross-validates prices with Solana DEXs:

```python
from clients.jupiter_client import get_jupiter_client

jupiter = get_jupiter_client()

# Get real-time DEX price
jupiter_price = await jupiter.get_price(token_mint="...")

# Check price spreads vs. Kraken
spread_info = await jupiter.check_price_spread(
    token_mint="...",
    reference_price=kraken_price,
    reference_source="Kraken"
)

# Identify arbitrage opportunities
if spread_info['arbitrage_opportunity']:
    print(f"⚡ Arbitrage: Jupiter ${spread_info['jupiter_price']:.6f} "
          f"vs Kraken ${spread_info['reference_price']:.6f}")
```

**Features:**
- Real-time quote fetching from Jupiter Aggregator v6
- Automatic caching (60-second TTL)
- Price spread detection and arbitrage opportunity flagging
- Liquidity depth analysis at multiple price levels

**Environment Variables:**

# Jupiter configuration (optional, uses defaults if not set)
JUPITER_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=60
```

### 6. DEX Execution Webhook (NEW - December 2025)

High-level webhook architecture for future bundler integration (Jito, Solayer):

```python
from services.dex_execution_webhook import get_dex_execution_webhook

webhook = get_dex_execution_webhook()

# Queue snipe execution (routes to external bundler service when configured)
success, message, request = await webhook.execute_snipe(
    token_mint="65aP2yHMZ6RxZpXn3iHhfBRnzCpwbZeVDTXAoi1gpump",
    amount_usd=25.0,
    slippage_bps=50,  # 0.5%
    metadata={'source': 'DEX_HUNTER', 'score': 82.5}
)

# Check execution status
status = webhook.get_status(request.request_id)

# Configure external services at runtime
webhook.configure_webhook('snipe', 'https://bundler.example.com/execute')
```

**Ready for Integration With:**
- **Jito Bundles** (Recommended - 45% Solana network coverage)
- **Solayer** (Privacy-focused validator MEV protection)
- **Custom Bundler Services** (Any HTTP webhook endpoint)

**Current Status:** ✅ Placeholders ready, awaiting external service configuration

**Setup Instructions:**

## ✨ Recent Updates (December 2025)

### LLM Integration Enhancement for Multi-Config & Ultimate Analysis (December 4, 2025)
- ✅ **Mode-Aware LLM Analysis:** Multi-config and Ultimate analysis modes now pass specialized context to LLMs
  - **Standard Mode:** Single strategy analysis with straightforward recommendations
  - **Multi-Config Mode:** Tests Long/Short scenarios, multiple timeframes, and leverage options
  - **Ultimate Mode:** Exhaustive analysis across ALL strategies, directions, and timeframes
- ✅ **Control Panel Custom Analysis Fix:** Custom analysis now properly passes asset type and mode
  - Previously, custom analysis ignored the selected asset type and analysis mode
  - Now correctly queues crypto/stock analysis with standard/multi/ultimate modes
- ✅ **Enhanced Analysis Queue Processor:** Mode-specific prompts guide LLM to appropriate depth
  - Standard: Focus on primary trading strategy
  - Multi-Config: Compare trend-following vs mean-reversion, long vs short
  - Ultimate: ALL strategies tested (Trend, Reversion, Momentum, Breakout, Scalping, Swing)
- ✅ **Stock Entry Assistant Upgrade:** Now accepts additional_context for mode-aware analysis
- ✅ **Unified LLM Context:** Both crypto and stock analysis use consistent mode context prompts

### AI Position Manager Alert Cooldown & Trading Style Enhancement (December 3, 2025)
- ✅ **Alert Cooldown System:** Prevents spam - each action type has configurable cooldown before repeated alerts
  - HODL: 4 hours between alerts
  - SWING: 1 hour between alerts
  - SCALP: 15 minutes between alerts
- ✅ **Minimum Hold Time Thresholds:** Prevents premature exit recommendations based on trading style
  - HODL: Won't suggest close for 168 hours (1 week)
  - SWING: Won't suggest close for 4 hours minimum
  - SCALP: No hold time restriction
- ✅ **Enhanced SWING Trading Style:** More patient, forward-looking AI analysis
  - Default action is HOLD unless compelling reason to exit
  - Considers trend continuation before suggesting exits
  - Requires higher confidence for exit recommendations
  - Distinguishes between "noise" and actual trend reversals
- ✅ **Trading Style Configurations:** Customizable thresholds per intent
  - Loss threshold: HODL=30%, SWING=12%, SCALP=3%
  - Profit suggestion: HODL=50%, SWING=15%, SCALP=5%
- ✅ **Alert Suppression Tracking:** Positions track how many alerts were suppressed for debugging
- ✅ **Position Intent API:** Set intent per position (`HODL`, `SWING`, `SCALP`) to control AI aggressiveness
- ✅ **Fixed Discord Approval Blocking:** All approval callbacks now run in threads to prevent UI hangs
- ✅ **TIGHTEN_STOP Execution:** Both crypto and stock managers now properly execute stop tightening with Discord notifications
  - Validates new stop is actually tighter (not looser)
  - Sends confirmation notification with protection percentage
  - Updates internal tracking (stops monitored by AI, not broker orders)
- ✅ **Stock Tighten Stop Support:** Added `tighten_stop()` method to AI Stock Position Manager
  - Mirrors crypto implementation for consistency
  - Sends Discord notification on successful adjustment

**Usage:** When adding positions or via the control panel, set the position intent:
```python
# For a mid-term swing trade (patient, fewer alerts)
manager.set_position_intent("BTC/USD", "SWING")

# For a long-term hold (minimal alerts, ride volatility)
manager.set_position_intent("BTC/USD", "HODL")

# For a quick scalp (tight stops, aggressive alerts)
manager.set_position_intent("BTC/USD", "SCALP")
```

**How Stops Work:**
- Stops are tracked **internally** by the AI Position Manager, NOT as broker orders
- When price hits the stop level, a **market order** is placed to close the position
- This allows flexible stop adjustments without modifying broker orders
- Kraken and most stock brokers don't easily support modifying existing stop orders

**Auto-Execute Adjustments (NEW):**
Safe position adjustments can now execute automatically without Discord approval:
- ✅ **TIGHTEN_STOP** - Auto-executes (raises stop to lock in profits)
- ✅ **EXTEND_TARGET** - Auto-executes (raises take profit target)
- ✅ **MOVE_TO_BREAKEVEN** - Auto-executes (moves stop to entry price)
- ❌ **CLOSE_NOW** - Requires approval (closes position)
- ❌ **TAKE_PARTIAL** - Requires approval (sells portion of position)

Toggle via code:
```python
manager.set_auto_execute_adjustments(True)   # Auto-execute safe adjustments (default)
manager.set_auto_execute_adjustments(False)  # Require approval for ALL actions
```

### Service Configuration Persistence Fix (December 3, 2025)
- ✅ **Fixed interval settings not persisting**: Service interval changes now properly save to file AND update session state
- ✅ **Tab section now restarts service**: Changing interval in the compact tab view now restarts service (was just saving without applying)
- ✅ **Cache clearing on save**: Config file cache is cleared after saves to ensure fresh values are read
- ✅ **Session state sync**: UI values now sync with config file values to prevent stale data
- ✅ **Presets update properly**: Quick preset buttons now update session state for consistency

- ✅ **Auto Kraken Init:** Function auto-creates Kraken client from environment variables if not provided
- ✅ **Workflow Watchlists:** Workflow tab now shows quick-view of current crypto and stock watchlists
- ✅ **Fixed Crypto Watchlist Source:** Service Status now uses `CryptoWatchlistManager` (same as Watchlists tab) instead of `TickerManager` - this ensures all 118+ crypto from Supabase are shown, not just 1

### Crypto Breakout Trade Execution from Discord (December 2, 2025)
- ✅ **Trade Button Added:** Crypto breakout alerts now have a 🚀 Trade button for direct execution
- ✅ **One-Click Trading:** Click Trade on any crypto alert to execute via AI Crypto Position Manager
