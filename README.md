## How to use the app (short walkthrough)

1. Start in Paper Trading Mode (default) ‚Äî this logs signals locally and prevents real executions.
2. Go to the "Stock Intelligence" tab and enter a ticker. Click Analyze to fetch history, compute indicators, extract news, and produce an AI-style recommendation.
3. Switch to the "Strategy Advisor" tab to input your profile (experience, capital, outlook) and generate personalized strategy suggestions.
4. Use "Generate Trading Signal" to populate a signal (you can load example trades). Click Validate to run guardrails, then Send Signal to log or dispatch the signal.
   - Paper mode logs to session state and keeps a local signal history.
   - Live mode will attempt to POST to the provided Option Alpha webhook URL or use the Tradier client if you integrate it.
5. Inspect and export your signals under "Signal History". You can edit fields in the interactive data editor and export CSV/JSON.
6. Advanced users: Use the "Strategy Analyzer" to analyze Option Alpha bot configs with an LLM. The analysis requires valid API credentials for your chosen provider.

## Testing

Run unit tests with pytest:

```powershell
pytest -q
```

Tests cover pricing functions and some analyzer helpers. They are useful to validate changes to pricing/greeks logic.

## Options concepts explained (practical glossary)

This short reference explains the most important options concepts used throughout the app. Each entry explains the meaning, why it matters, and a short practical tip.

### DTE ‚Äî Days to Expiration

- What it is: Number of calendar days remaining until the option contract expires.
- Why it matters: DTE controls time value (theta). Shorter DTE means faster time decay and typically lower premium for the same strike. Many strategies choose a DTE band to target (e.g., 7‚Äì45 days).
- Practical tip: Use shorter DTE if you want quick time decay (selling premium), and longer DTE to reduce gamma risk for directional buys.

### Implied Volatility (IV)

- What it is: The market's expectation of future volatility embedded in option prices. IV is inferred from market option prices using a pricing model.
- Why it matters: Higher IV ‚Üí higher option premiums ‚Üí better for premium sellers. Lower IV ‚Üí cheaper options ‚Üí better for buyers.
- Practical tip: Always compare IV to historical volatility and to the rest of the market (IV Rank) before deciding to buy or sell premium.

### IV Rank and IV Percentile

- What IV Rank means: IV Rank is a normalized measure that shows where current IV sits relative to its historical range (commonly the past 52 weeks). If IV Rank is 80, current IV is high relative to the last year.
- IV Percentile: Similar idea; percentile of daily IV values over a lookback window.
- Why it matters: IV Rank tells you whether option prices are unusually expensive or cheap for this underlying. High IV Rank favors selling premium; low IV Rank favors buying.
- Practical tip: Use IV Rank thresholds in the app (e.g., >60 = prefer selling strategies, <40 = buying strategies).

### Theta ‚Äî Time Decay

- What it is: Theta is the rate at which an option's extrinsic value decays as time passes (usually quoted per day).
- Why it matters: Theta works against buyers (they lose time value each day) and helps sellers (they collect decay). Theta accelerates as DTE approaches zero, especially in the last 30 days.
- Practical tip: If you sell premium, you're collecting theta ‚Äî but beware that gamma increases near expiry, making large moves more impactful.

### Vega ‚Äî Sensitivity to Volatility

- What it is: Vega measures how much an option's price will change for a 1 percentage-point change in IV (often expressed per 1 vol point).
- Why it matters: Options with higher vega are more sensitive to IV moves. Long options gain when IV rises; short options lose when IV rises.
- Practical tip: When trading around events (earnings), expect vega to move; selling premium into high vega can be profitable if realized volatility stays lower than implied.

### Delta & Gamma ‚Äî Directional Risk and Convexity

- Delta: The option's approximate sensitivity to a small move in the underlying (0‚Äì1 for calls, -1‚Äì0 for puts). Delta can be interpreted as the approximate probability the option finishes in the money for short-dated options.
- Gamma: The rate of change of delta as the underlying moves. High gamma means delta can move quickly ‚Äî this increases risk for short options and potential reward for long options.
- Practical tip: Long options gain gamma (benefit from large moves) while short options carry gamma risk near expiry.

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic (Time) Value

- Intrinsic value: The immediate exercise value (for a call: underlying - strike if positive). Intrinsic cannot be negative.
- Extrinsic value: The remainder of the option premium (price - intrinsic). This includes time value and implied vol component.
- Practical tip: Deep in-the-money options are largely intrinsic (less sensitivity to IV), while out-of-the-money options are mostly extrinsic (more sensitive to IV and theta).

### Skew and Term Structure

- Skew: The difference in implied volatility across strikes. Equity indices usually exhibit higher IV for lower strikes (put skew) reflecting demand for downside protection.
- Term structure: How IV changes across expirations (near-term vs back-term). A steep term structure means near-term IV differs a lot from back-term IV.
- Practical tip: Use skew and term-structure awareness to design spread trades (e.g., diagonal spreads) that exploit relative mispricings.

### Probability, Breakeven & Moneyness

- Moneyness: Relationship between spot and strike (ITM, ATM, OTM). ATM options have the most extrinsic value and highest vega.
- Breakeven: For a long call, breakeven = strike + premium paid; for a short option, breakeven is adjusted accordingly.
- Practical tip: Translate model outputs (delta, P&L scenarios) into simple breakeven levels before placing a trade.

### Example: How terms drive strategy selection

- Selling premium (e.g., iron condor, short strangle): Prefer high IV Rank, low likelihood of a large move, and enough DTE to collect theta but not so short that gamma risk explodes.
- Buying options (e.g., long calls/puts, straddles): Prefer low IV (cheap premium) or a specific event where you expect realized vol > implied vol. Choose DTE to balance time decay vs gamma exposure.

### Quick rules of thumb

- IV Rank > 60 ‚Üí consider premium-selling or defined-risk credit strategies.
- IV Rank < 40 ‚Üí consider buying directional options or debit spreads.
- DTE 7‚Äì45 ‚Üí common sweet spot for many income-oriented strategies (sells collect theta but avoid extreme gamma).
- Always check upcoming catalysts (earnings, dividends) ‚Äî they can invalidate otherwise-sensible trades.

## üìä Advanced EMA/DeMarker/Fibonacci Trading System

The platform now includes a sophisticated swing and options trading framework based on the **8-21 EMA Power Zone**, **DeMarker oscillator**, and **Fibonacci A-B-C extensions**. This system provides precise entry timing, dynamic stops, and target-based scale-outs.

### **Core Components:**

#### **1. EMA(8/21) Power Zone & Reclaim**

- **Power Zone**: Price > EMA8 > EMA21 signals strong uptrend momentum
- **Reclaim**: Prior close below EMAs ‚Üí current close above both with rising EMAs, volume surge, and follow-through
- **Usage**: High-probability swing entries and options structure selection

#### **2. DeMarker(14) Oscillator**

- **Range**: 0-1 oscillator measuring buying/selling pressure
- **Oversold**: ‚â§ 0.30 in uptrend = pullback entry opportunity
- **Overbought**: ‚â• 0.70 in downtrend = bounce short opportunity
- **Usage**: Precision timing for swing trades and options entries

#### **3. Fibonacci A-B-C Extensions**

- **Pattern**: A (low) ‚Üí B (high) ‚Üí C (pullback) ‚Üí Targets
- **Targets**:
  - T1 (127.2%): Take 25% profit
  - T2 (161.8%): Take 50% profit
  - T3 (200-261.8%): Trail remaining with stop below 21 EMA
- **Usage**: Strike selection for options spreads, scale-out planning

#### **4. Multi-Timeframe Alignment**

- **Analysis**: Weekly, Daily, 4-Hour trend confirmation using EMA8/21
- **Alignment Score**: 0-100% showing agreement across timeframes
- **Aligned**: ‚â•66.7% (2 of 3 timeframes agree)
- **Usage**: Filter for highest-confidence setups, boost confidence score

#### **5. Sector Relative Strength**

- **Comparison**: Stock vs Sector ETF vs SPY (3-month performance)
- **RS Score**: 0-100 scale (50 = market neutral, >60 = outperforming)
- **Usage**: Trade leading stocks in leading sectors, avoid laggards

### **How It Works in Each Trading Style:**

#### **Swing Trading**

```
‚úÖ Entry Checklist:
- EMA Power Zone or Reclaim confirmed
- DeMarker ‚â§ 0.30 in uptrend (pullback entry)

```

#### **Options Trading (Enhanced)**

```
üî• EMA Reclaim Signals:
- Reclaim + High IV (>60): SELL cash-secured puts at 21 EMA (30-45 DTE)
- Reclaim + Low IV (<40): BUY call spreads ATM to T1 strike (45-60 DTE)

üìê Fibonacci-Based Strike Selection:
- Long call spread: Buy ATM, Sell at T1 (127.2% target)
- Time to target: 30-60 DTE
- Bull put spread: Sell 10-15% OTM below C (support)

üéØ DeMarker Timing:
- DeMarker ‚â§ 0.30 in uptrend: Time call entries for bounce
- Ideal for 0-14 DTE scalps or 30-45 DTE swings

üìä Multi-Timeframe Filter:
- Only trade options when 2+ timeframes aligned
- Higher alignment = higher confidence = larger position size
```

### **Confidence Score Enhancement:**

The confidence calculation now incorporates:

- **Base Score**: RSI, MACD, IV Rank, sentiment, catalysts, earnings risk (up to 90 points)
- **Timeframe Bonus**: +10 points for aligned trends across timeframes
- **Sector RS Bonus**: +10 points for strong relative strength (RS > 60)
- **Maximum Score**: 100 (requires all factors aligned)

**Confidence Levels:**

top_opps = scanner.get_top_opportunities(tickers, top_n=10)

# Scan all presets
all_results = scanner.scan_all_presets(tickers)
```

**Built-in Watchlists:**

- `get_sp500_tickers()` - S&P 500 stocks
- `get_nasdaq100_tickers()` - NASDAQ 100 stocks
- `get_high_volume_tech()` - High volume tech stocks

### **4. Fibonacci-Based Options Chain Integration** üìà

Auto-populate option strikes and suggest spreads based on Fibonacci levels.

**Features:**

- Automatically finds strikes near Fib A, B, C, T1, T2, T3
- Suggests spreads based on trend and IV context
- Real-time options data from yfinance
- Risk metrics: max profit/loss, breakeven, probability

**Usage:**

```python
from services.options_chain_fib import FibonacciOptionsChain

# Analyze for Fibonacci pattern
analysis = ComprehensiveAnalyzer.analyze_stock("AAPL", "OPTIONS")

if analysis.fib_targets:
    # Get options chain
    fib_chain = FibonacciOptionsChain("AAPL")
  
    # Find strikes near Fibonacci levels (45 DTE)
    fib_strikes = fib_chain.find_strikes_near_fibonacci(
        analysis.fib_targets, 
        target_dte=45
    )
    fib_chain.print_fibonacci_strikes(fib_strikes)
  
    # Get spread suggestions
    spreads = fib_chain.suggest_fibonacci_spreads(
        analysis.fib_targets, 
        analysis, 
        target_dte=45
    )
    fib_chain.print_spread_suggestions(spreads)
  
    # Get best spread by risk/reward
    best = max(spreads, key=lambda s: s.risk_reward_ratio)
```

**Auto-Generated Spreads:**

- **Bull Call Spread (T1)**: Buy ATM, Sell at T1 (127.2%) - Uptrend setups
- **Bull Put Spread (C Support)**: Sell at C, Buy lower - EMA Reclaim + High IV
- **Wide Call Spread (T2)**: Buy ATM, Sell at T2 (161.8%) - Strong uptrend

**Strike Information:**

- Strike price (closest to Fib level)
- Distance from spot (%)
- Bid/Ask spreads
- Open interest (liquidity)
- Greeks (Delta, Theta, Vega)

### **Complete Daily Workflow Example:**

```python
# 1. Scan for high-conviction setups
scanner = PresetScanner()
top_setups = scanner.get_top_opportunities(get_high_volume_tech(), top_n=5)

# 2. Backtest each opportunity
bt = EMAFibonacciBacktester(require_reclaim=True, require_alignment=True)

for setup in top_setups:
    results = bt.backtest(setup.ticker, "2023-01-01", "2024-10-01")
  
    # 3. If backtest is positive, analyze options
    if results.win_rate > 60 and results.profit_factor > 1.5:
        if setup.analysis.fib_targets:
            fib_chain = FibonacciOptionsChain(setup.ticker)
            spreads = fib_chain.suggest_fibonacci_spreads(
                setup.analysis.fib_targets, setup.analysis, 45
            )
          
            # 4. Execute best spread
            if spreads:
                best = max(spreads, key=lambda s: s.risk_reward_ratio)
                print(f"‚úì TRADE: {best.strategy_name}")
```

## üì≤ Alert System: My Tickers & Position Monitoring

The platform includes a comprehensive alert system that sends Discord/webhook notifications for both **pre-trade setups** and **active position updates**.

### **Two Alert Types:**

#### **1. Technical Setup Alerts** üéØ

Pre-trade signals based on EMA reclaims, timeframe alignment, and other technical patterns.

**Default**: Alerts for ALL scanned tickers
**Filtered**: Enable `my_tickers_only=True` to only alert for tickers in your **‚≠ê My Tickers** list (the ones you save in the app)

```python
from services.preset_scanners import PresetScanner
from services.ticker_manager import TickerManager

ticker_manager = TickerManager()

# Only alert for your saved tickers (TSLA, AMC, AMD, etc.)
scanner = PresetScanner(
    my_tickers_only=True,
    ticker_manager=ticker_manager
)

# Scan 500 stocks - only your My Tickers trigger alerts
scanner.scan(sp500_tickers, ScanPreset.TRIPLE_THREAT)
```

**Alert Priorities:**

- **CRITICAL**: Triple Threat, EMA Reclaim
- **HIGH**: Timeframe Aligned, Sector Leaders, Fibonacci Setups
- **MEDIUM**: DeMarker Entry Signals

#### **2. Position Monitoring Alerts** üìä

Real-time updates on ALL your active trades (from Tradier).

```python
from services.position_monitor import get_position_monitor
from services.alert_system import get_alert_system

position_monitor = get_position_monitor(
    alert_system=get_alert_system(),
    tradier_client=tradier_client
)

# Configure thresholds
position_monitor.pnl_alert_threshold = 5.0  # Alert every 5% P&L change
position_monitor.significant_loss_threshold = -10.0  # Alert on 10% loss
position_monitor.significant_gain_threshold = 15.0  # Alert on 15% gain

# Update positions (call periodically)
success, alerts = position_monitor.update_positions()
```

**Position Alert Types:**

- ‚úÖ **Position Opened** - When new trade detected
- ‚ùå **Position Closed** - Final P&L on exit
- üéØ **Profit Target Hit** - Price reaches target
- üõë **Stop Loss Hit** - Stop triggered
- üìä **Position Updates** - Regular P&L changes (every 5%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Significant Loss** - Alert on -10% or worse
- üöÄ **Significant Gain** - Alert on +15% or better

### **Managing Your "My Tickers"**

Add/remove tickers via the **‚≠ê My Tickers** tab in the app, or programmatically:

```python
from services.ticker_manager import TickerManager

tm = TickerManager()

# Add ticker
tm.add_ticker('NVDA', name='NVIDIA', ticker_type='stock')

# Remove ticker
tm.remove_ticker('NVDA')

# View all
my_tickers = tm.get_all_tickers()
print([t['ticker'] for t in my_tickers])  # ['TSLA', 'AMC', 'AMD', 'COIN']
```

### **Discord Integration**

Both alert types send to the same Discord webhook (configured in your `.env`):

```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

### **Demo Scripts**

```powershell
# Test position monitoring
python examples/position_monitoring_demo.py --mode monitor

# View your My Tickers setup
python examples/my_tickers_alert_demo.py --mode show
```

### **Recommended Setup**

```python
# Technical alerts: My Tickers ONLY (stocks you're watching)
scanner = PresetScanner(my_tickers_only=True, ticker_manager=ticker_manager)

# Position alerts: ALL trades (everything you have open)
position_monitor = get_position_monitor(alert_system, tradier_client)

# Result:
# ‚úÖ Pre-trade alerts for stocks you're actively following
# ‚úÖ Active trade alerts for all your positions
```

## üéØ ML-Enhanced Trading Workflow (Recommended)

For the **most confident trading decisions**, use the ML-Enhanced Scanner that combines three analysis systems:

### **Triple-Validation System:**

1. **ML Analysis (40% weight)** - Qlib models trained on 158 alpha factors

   - Detects complex patterns across price, volume, momentum, volatility
   - Predicts probability of profitable moves
   - Adapts to changing market conditions
2. **LLM Analysis (35% weight)** - GPT/Claude/Llama reasoning

   - Provides contextual understanding and risk analysis
   - Explains *why* a trade makes sense
   - Identifies hidden risks and catalysts
3. **Quantitative Analysis (25% weight)** - Traditional technical signals

   - RSI, MACD, IV Rank, volume analysis
   - Proven indicators and patterns
   - Fast execution and reliability

### **Your Daily Workflow:**

```powershell
# Run the ML-enhanced daily scan
python examples/ml_enhanced_trading_workflow.py

# Save results to watchlist
python examples/ml_enhanced_trading_workflow.py --save

# Backtest the strategy
python examples/ml_enhanced_trading_workflow.py --backtest
```

### **In Python Code:**

```python
from services.ml_enhanced_scanner import MLEnhancedScanner

# Initialize scanner (auto-detects ML and LLM availability)
scanner = MLEnhancedScanner()

# Get highest confidence options trades
# Only returns trades scoring high on ALL THREE systems
trades = scanner.scan_top_options_with_ml(
    top_n=10,
    min_ensemble_score=70.0  # 70% combined confidence minimum
)

# Analyze top pick
for trade in trades:
    print(f"{trade.ticker}: Combined Score {trade.combined_score:.1f}")
    print(f"  ML: {trade.ml_prediction_score:.1f}")
    print(f"  LLM: {trade.ai_rating * 10:.1f}")
    print(f"  Quant: {trade.score:.1f}")
  
    # Get detailed explanation
    explanation = scanner.get_trade_explanation(trade)
    print(explanation)
```

### **Why This Workflow Works:**

- **Higher Win Rate**: Three independent systems must agree
- **Better Risk Management**: LLM identifies risks ML might miss
- **Adaptive**: ML retrains on recent data, adapting to market changes
- **Explainable**: You know exactly WHY each trade is recommended
- **Backtestable**: Validate strategy performance before live trading

### **Confidence Levels Explained:**

- **VERY HIGH (85+)**: All three systems highly confident - **strongest trades**
- **HIGH (75-84)**: Strong agreement across systems - **good trades**
- **MEDIUM-HIGH (60-74)**: Decent signals but monitor closely
- **Below 60**: Too much uncertainty, avoid or wait

### **Risk Management:**

- Never risk more than 2% of capital per trade
- Size positions inversely to risk level (High Risk = smaller size)
- Use LLM risk analysis to set appropriate stop losses
- Diversify across multiple high-confidence opportunities
- Backtest before deploying new strategies

)

# Initialize scanner
scanner = AdvancedOpportunityScanner(use_ai=True)

# Create filters
filters = ScanFilters(
    min_price=1.0,
    max_price=5.0,
    min_volume_ratio=2.0,  # 2x average volume
    min_score=65.0,
    require_power_zone=True,
    min_rsi=30,

### **Buzzing Stocks Detection with Social Sentiment:**

The buzzing scanner now uses **Crawl4ai** for comprehensive social sentiment analysis across multiple platforms:

```python
# Scan for stocks showing unusual activity + social buzz
buzzing = scanner.scan_buzzing_stocks(
    top_n=20,
    lookback_days=5,
    min_buzz_score=30.0  # Lower threshold for broader results
)

for stock in buzzing:
    print(f"{stock.ticker}: Buzz Score {stock.buzz_score:.0f}")
    print(f"  {', '.join(stock.buzz_reasons)}")
    # Example reasons:
    # "Volume surge 3.2x average"
    # "üì± 25 Reddit mentions (BULLISH)"
    # "üê¶ 18 Twitter mentions"
    # "üí¨ 12 StockTwits messages (BULLISH)"
    # "üì∞ 8 news articles"
    # "üî• Trending (score: 78)"
```

### **What Makes a Stock "Buzzing"?**

The buzz detection combines **technical analysis (60%)** + **social sentiment (40%)**:

#### **Technical Buzz (60% weight):**
- **Volume Surge (40 pts)**: Recent volume 2-3x+ average
- **Volatility Spike (30 pts)**: Price swings 1.5-2x+ normal
- **Consecutive Moves (20 pts)**: Multiple days of >2% moves
- **Gap Moves (10 pts)**: Gap up/down >3-5%

#### **Social Sentiment (40% weight) - NEW:**
- **Reddit mentions (0-50 pts)**: 10 popular subreddits (wallstreetbets, stocks, investing, options, StockMarket, pennystocks, Daytrading, swingtrading, wallstreetbetsOGs, thetagang) - searches for both `$TICKER` and `TICKER`
- **Twitter mentions (0-30 pts)**: Via Nitter mirrors (no login required) - searches for `$TICKER` first (standard Twitter format)
- **StockTwits sentiment (0-20 pts)**: Real-time trader sentiment with bullish/bearish tags
- **Financial news (0-20 pts)**: Article volume from Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha
- **Sentiment boost (0-20 pts)**: Bullish vs bearish keyword analysis

**Combined Buzz Score Interpretation:**
- **75-100**: Extremely hot - Major technical + social attention
- **60-74**: Very buzzing - Strong interest across sources
- **50-59**: Buzzing - Elevated activity
- **30-49**: Moderate interest - Worth monitoring
- **<30**: Normal activity

### **Social Sentiment Data Sources:**

| Source | Access Method | Search Format | Login Required | Coverage |
|--------|--------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Reddit** | Crawl4ai + BM25 scoring | `$TICKER OR TICKER` | ‚ùå No | 10 subreddits, 5 checked per scan, 30 posts each |
| **Twitter/X** | Nitter mirrors | `$TICKER OR TICKER` | ‚ùå No | Multiple mirror instances, 20+ tweets |
| **StockTwits** | Public streams | `TICKER` | ‚ùå No | Real-time stream, 30+ messages |
| **News** | yfinance API | `TICKER` | ‚ùå No | Yahoo Finance, 10+ articles |

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **JavaScript Rendering**: Access dynamic/JS-heavy sites
- ‚úÖ **Stealth Mode**: Bypass bot detection
- ‚úÖ **BM25 Link Scoring**: Find most relevant discussions
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Crawling**: Fast multi-source scraping
- ‚úÖ **Sentiment Analysis**: Bullish/bearish keyword matching
- ‚úÖ **No Login Walls**: Uses public endpoints and mirrors

**Excluded Sources:**
- ‚ùå Instagram (not relevant for trading)
- ‚ùå Facebook (minimal trading discussion)

### **Installation:**

The social sentiment analyzer requires **Crawl4ai**:

```powershell
# Install Crawl4ai
pip install crawl4ai

# Setup browser for JS rendering
crawl4ai-setup

# Test installation
python test_crawl4ai.py
```

### **Example Output:**

```
NVDA - Buzz Score: 85.4/100 (VERY HIGH)
‚îú‚îÄ Volume surge 3.2x average
‚îú‚îÄ High volatility spike
‚îú‚îÄ üì± 25 Reddit mentions (BULLISH)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ "NVDA calls printing üöÄ earnings crush expected"
‚îú‚îÄ üê¶ 18 Twitter mentions
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ "NVDA breaking ATH, AI demand unstoppable"
‚îú‚îÄ üí¨ 12 StockTwits messages (BULLISH)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ 83% bullish sentiment
‚îú‚îÄ üì∞ 8 news articles
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ "NVIDIA Earnings Beat, Revenue Guidance Raised"
‚îî‚îÄ üî• Trending (score: 78)
```

### **Performance:**
- **Single ticker**: 10-20 seconds (comprehensive analysis)
- **5 tickers**: 1-2 minutes
- **20 tickers**: 4-8 minutes

**Note**: Slower than technical-only analysis but provides comprehensive social sentiment data.

### **Reverse Split Tracking (Penny Stocks):**

The scanner automatically detects reverse stock splits in penny stocks, especially critical for sub-$1 micro-pennies. Reverse splits often indicate financial distress and can be warning signs of dilution risk.

**What's Tracked:**
- **Reverse Split History**: Last 3 years of reverse splits with dates and ratios
- **Recent Reverse Splits**: Flags splits within last 12 months
- **Risk Warnings**: Automatic severity assessment based on split frequency

**Warning Levels:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH RISK**: 3+ reverse splits in 3 years - Extreme caution advised
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION**: 2 reverse splits in 3 years - High dilution risk
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recent**: Reverse split within last year - Monitor closely
- **Previous**: Historical split detected - Note for context

**Example Output:**
```
MULN: Score 65.2 | $0.45 (+8.3%)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 reverse splits in 3y - HIGH RISK
  Split History: 1:10 on 2024-03-15, 1:25 on 2023-08-22, 1:15 on 2022-11-10
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Companies with multiple reverse splits often dilute shareholders repeatedly
- Sub-$1 stocks with split history have higher bankruptcy risk
- Pattern indicates inability to maintain listing requirements
- Useful for risk assessment before entering penny stock positions

**Usage in Scan Results:**
- Prominently displayed in red error boxes for penny stocks
- Included in CSV export with split count and warning
- Filters opportunities by reverse split risk tolerance

### **Reverse Merger Candidate Detection:**

The scanner identifies potential reverse merger candidates using speculation, sentiment analysis, and corporate indicators. Reverse mergers involve shell companies merging with private companies to go public faster than traditional IPOs.

**Detection Algorithm (Score 0-100):**

**1. Shell Company Indicators (40 points)**
- Micro-cap (<$50M) = 20 pts, Small-cap (<$100M) = 10 pts
- Low average volume (<100k) = 10 pts (low liquidity)
- No/minimal revenue = 10 pts (shell characteristic)

**2. Recent Unusual Activity (30 points)**
- Massive volume spike (>5x) = 20 pts
- Unusual volume (>3x) = 10 pts  
- Large price move (>20%) = 10 pts

**3. Sentiment & News Indicators (30 points)**
- High speculation sentiment + micro-cap = 15 pts
- Merger-related news keywords detected = 15 pts
  - Keywords: "merger", "acquisition", "reverse merger", "SPAC", "combination", "transaction", "deal", "takeover", "agreement"
- High news activity (>5 recent items) = 5 pts

**Merger Candidate Threshold:**
- Score ‚â•50 = Flagged as merger candidate
- Score 50-69 = Possible merger play
- Score 70-100 = Strong merger candidate signals

**Example Output:**
```
PHUN: Score 72.5 | $0.85 (+25.7%)
  üîÑ Reverse Merger Candidate (Score: 72)
  üîÑ Merger Signals: Micro-cap $45.2M, Massive volume 8.2x, 
      Merger-related news detected, High speculation sentiment
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Reverse mergers can lead to explosive price movements (50-500%+)
- Early detection before merger announcement = profit opportunity
- High speculation activity often precedes major corporate events
- Buzzing stocks + merger signals = potential multi-bagger plays

**Integration with Buzzing Scanner:**
- Merger candidate detection is automatically run on buzzing stocks
- If buzzing stock is also merger candidate, buzz score receives +10 bonus
- Merger candidate signals appear in buzzing reasons list
- Creates "double signal" for highest-probability speculative plays

**Usage:**
```python
# Filter for merger candidates
opportunities = scanner.scan_opportunities(
    scan_type=ScanType.PENNY_STOCKS,
    filters=ScanFilters(max_price=2.0, min_volume_ratio=3.0)
)

# Check for merger candidates
merger_candidates = [o for o in opportunities if o.is_merger_candidate]

for candidate in merger_candidates:
    print(f"{candidate.ticker}: Merger Score {candidate.merger_score:.0f}")
    print(f"  Signals: {', '.join(candidate.merger_signals)}")
```

**Risk Disclaimer:**
- Merger candidates are **highly speculative** plays
- Many shell companies never complete mergers
- High volatility and dilution risk
- Due diligence essential - verify news sources
- Position size should be minimal (1-2% of portfolio max)
- Set tight stop losses (10-15%)

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Start Broad**: Use "All Opportunities" to see overall market
2. **Refine**: Apply quick filters to narrow focus
3. **Cross-Reference**: Compare with your existing analysis
4. **Monitor Buzzing**: Check daily for emerging plays
5. **Backtest**: Validate setups with historical data
6. **Combine with Alerts**: Add top finds to My Tickers for notifications
7. **Export**: Save results for review and comparison

### **Integration with Other Features:**

- **Works with My Tickers**: Add discoveries to watchlist
- **Feeds into Analysis**: Click "Full Analysis" for deep dive
- **Complements ML Scanner**: Use together for maximum confidence
- **Alert Ready**: Set up alerts on discovered opportunities
- **CSV Export**: Export for spreadsheet analysis or backtesting

---

## Design notes & limitations

- The app relies on `yfinance` for market data and news. yfinance may occasionally return incomplete or missing fields (e.g., option chains or news). The code contains fallbacks when data is missing.
- IV Rank/Percentile is estimated/simulated in `TechnicalAnalyzer.calculate_iv_metrics` and should be treated as an approximation. For production IV metrics use a dedicated options data provider with historical IV surfaces.
- LLM integration is optional and can be configured to use different providers. The analyzer expects the LLM to return valid JSON embedded in the response; if parsing fails a helpful error analysis is returned instead.
- Tradier client uses simplified option symbol formatting ‚Äî you may need to adapt `convert_signal_to_order` to match your broker's exact option symbol conventions.
- The app uses Streamlit's newer features (data_editor, status, toggle). Compatibility shims exist in `app.py` to gracefully degrade when running older Streamlit versions but features may be limited.
- **Qlib integration** is optional and requires separate installation (`pip install pyqlib`). If not installed, the app gracefully falls back to standard analysis methods.

## Security & safety

- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control.
- Keep the app in Paper Trading Mode while configuring and testing.
