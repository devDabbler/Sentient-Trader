## üí° Best Practices

- **Composite 50-64**: Moderate opportunity - proceed with caution
- **Composite <50**: Weak signal - consider removing

### 3. **Risk Management**
- Always review risk narrative before trading
- High confidence ‚â† no risk
- Diversify across sectors and confidence levels
- Use stop-losses and position sizing

### 4. **Filtering Strategy**
- Start broad, narrow down based on your criteria
- Consider combining filters (e.g., High Confidence + Tech Sector)
- Export filtered results for further analysis

## üîÑ Migration from Google Sheets

If you have existing data in Google Sheets:

1. **Export from Google Sheets**
   - File ‚Üí Download ‚Üí CSV

2. **Import to Watchlist**
   ```python
   from watchlist_manager import WatchlistManager
   wm = WatchlistManager()
   wm.import_from_csv('your_export.csv')
   ```

3. **Refresh Data**
   - Use the dashboard to refresh each stock
   - This will recalculate all scores with live data

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

    'VALUATION': 0.25,
    'CATALYST': 0.20,
    'TECHNICAL': 0.10,
    'NEWS_SENTIMENT': 0.10
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors:
```powershell
# Delete and recreate database
rm watchlist.db
# Restart app - database will be recreated
```

### Missing Data
- Some penny stocks lack analyst coverage (normal)
- Technical indicators require sufficient price history
- News may be sparse for very small companies

### Performance
- First analysis of a stock takes longer (fetching data)
- Subsequent refreshes are faster (some caching)
- Limit watchlist to 50-100 stocks for best performance
