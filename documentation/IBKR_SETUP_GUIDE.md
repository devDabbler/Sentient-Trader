## Configuring API Access

### Enable API Connections in IB Gateway

1. **In IB Gateway:**
   - Click on **Configure** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **API** ‚Üí **Settings**
   
2. **Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients:**
   - Check the box "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"
   
3. **Set Socket Port:**
   - Paper Trading: Default is `4002`
   - Live Trading: Default is `4001`
   - **Note:** TWS uses `7497` for paper and `7496` for live
   
4. **Trusted IP Addresses:**
   - By default, only `127.0.0.1` (localhost) is trusted
   - For local use, this is sufficient
   
5. **Read-Only API:**
   - **Uncheck** "Read-Only API" to enable trading
   - Leave checked if you only want market data
   
6. **Allow Connections from localhost only:**

If you prefer TWS over IB Gateway:

1. Launch TWS
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Global Configuration** ‚Üí **API** ‚Üí **Settings**
3. Same configuration as above
4. TWS uses ports `7497` (paper) and `7496` (live) by default

## Important Notes for Cash Accounts

### Trading Restrictions

1. **T+2 Settlement**: Cash from stock sales settles in 2 business days
2. **Good Faith Violations**: Buying and selling before settlement uses good faith
3. **Free-Riding**: Buying with unsettled funds and selling before settlement
4. **Pattern Day Trader (PDT)**: 
   - **< $25,000**: Max 3 day trades per 5 trading days
   - **‚â• $25,000**: Unlimited day trades

### Best Practices for Cash Accounts

1. **Track Settlement Dates**: Know when your cash settles
2. **Use Settled Cash**: Only trade with settled funds to avoid violations
3. **Monitor Day Trades**: Stay within your 3 day trade limit if under $25k
4. **Plan Positions**: With T+2 settlement, plan your trades carefully

### Scalping with Cash Account

For active scalping with a cash account:

1. **Split Capital**: Use 1/3 of capital per day to rotate through settlements
2. **Trade High Volume Stocks**: Easier to enter/exit (penny stocks may be risky)
3. **Use Limit Orders**: Control execution prices
4. **Set Stop Losses**: Protect against large losses
5. **Consider Upgrading**: Margin accounts offer more flexibility for day trading

---

## Day Trading Strategies

### Momentum Scalping

1. Scan for high volume movers (use **üí∞ Top Penny Stocks** tab)
2. Enter on breakouts with tight stops
3. Take quick profits (0.5% - 2%)
4. Exit before end of day

### Range Trading

1. Identify support/resistance levels
2. Buy near support, sell near resistance
3. Use limit orders at key levels
4. Tight stops below support

### News Trading

1. Monitor **Stock Intelligence** tab for catalysts
2. Trade on earnings, upgrades, news
3. Be cautious of volatility
4. Use smaller position sizes
