This gives you **flexibility** to choose the approach that fits your:
- Risk tolerance
- Capital availability
- Trading experience
- Market conditions

### **Confidence Levels:**

| Score | Badge | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 75+ | ✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE | Strong signals, larger position OK |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Stock Trades:**
1. **Day Trading:**

   - Tight stops (3-5%)
   - Exit by market close

### **Options Trades:**
1. **Check the suggested strike and expiration**
   - You'll need to look up the exact option symbol
   - Example: TSLA250117C255 = TSLA Call, Jan 17 2025, $255 strike
   
2. **Start small:**
   - 1-2 contracts for first trade
   - Scale up as you gain confidence
