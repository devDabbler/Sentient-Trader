# Trading Styles Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive trading style selector that provides personalized recommendations for different trading approaches.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Trading Style Options**

- üìä **Day Trade** - Intraday equity trades, exit by market close (0.5-3% targets)
- üìà **Swing Trade** - Multi-day equity holds, 3-10 day timeframe (5-15% targets)
- ‚ö° **Scalp** - Ultra-short term, seconds to minutes (0.1-0.5% targets, high risk)
- üíé **Buy & Hold** - Long-term investing, 6+ months (20%+ annual targets)
- üéØ **Options** - Calls, puts, spreads based on IV and trend analysis

### 2. **New Recommendation Functions**

- Multi-day trend following strategies
- RSI pullback entries in trends

- Moderate stops (3-5%) and targets (8-15%)

#### Scalping (`_generate_scalp_recommendation`)
- Extreme momentum-based entries

- Requires Level 2 data and fast execution
- High-risk warnings for inexperienced traders

#### Buy & Hold (`_generate_buy_hold_recommendation`)
- Long-term trend assessment
- Value analysis using RSI
- Dollar-cost averaging strategies
- Wide stops (15%) for long-term holds
- Fundamental review recommendations

#### Options (`_generate_options_recommendation`)
- IV-based strategies (high IV = sell premium, low IV = buy options)
