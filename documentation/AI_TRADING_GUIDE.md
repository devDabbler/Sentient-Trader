## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### AI Limitations

**The AI is NOT perfect:**
- Market can be unpredictable
- News can change instantly
- Technical signals can fail
- Social sentiment can be wrong

**Always:**
- Use your own judgment
- Start with small positions
- Follow risk management rules
- Never blindly follow AI

### Cash Account Restrictions

Remember your cash account rules:
- T+2 settlement on proceeds
- Good faith violations (avoid!)
- 3 day trades max per 5 days (if <$25k)
- Close all positions same day when scalping

### Market Conditions

AI works best when:
- ‚úÖ Normal market volatility
- ‚úÖ Liquid, high-volume stocks
- ‚úÖ Clear trends (up or down)
- ‚úÖ Recent news catalysts

AI struggles with:
- ‚ùå Extreme volatility (crashes)
- ‚ùå Low-volume penny stocks
- ‚ùå Sideways, choppy markets
- ‚ùå No clear catalysts

## üéì Learning from AI

### What to Watch

Pay attention to:
1. **When AI is right** - What patterns led to success?
2. **When AI is wrong** - What did it miss?
3. **Confidence levels** - Are 85% signals better than 65%?
4. **Score patterns** - Do you prefer technical or sentiment driven?

### Improving Over Time

- Keep a trading journal
- Note AI reasoning vs actual outcome
- Find your edge (e.g., "I'm best with high technical scores")
- Refine your symbol selection

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"No signals generated"**
- Try different symbols
- Market might be flat today
- Lower risk tolerance might find opportunities

**"AI analysis failed"**
- Check API key is set (OpenRouter)
- Verify internet connection
- Try different AI provider

**"Signal confidence too low"**
- Market conditions unclear
- Mixed signals from data sources
- Wait for better setups

**"Position size too small/large"**
- AI uses your account balance
- Adjust risk tolerance setting
- Manual override is fine
